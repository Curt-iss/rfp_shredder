Sam_Scraper
=======================================
A webscraper to pull documents from [beta.sam.gov](https://beta.sam.gov/).

Intent
---------------------------------------

A part of this overall project involves using a given Request-For-Proposal and estimating features (e.g. reward value). To accomplish this, I think we'll need to analyze the text of many RFPs. Using this analysis, we can try to determine a relation between an RFP and it's features.

With the current number of RFPs we have (maybe 15 or so) I don't think the above project is even worth attempting. With a few hundred, I think we can develop some proof of concept. With a few thousand, I think this RFP analysis becomes viable.

I hope TeraThink supplies us with as many RFPs as they can give us. I think it's best to use TeraThink's past to predict TeraThink's future. In the case that TeraThink can't give us enough data, I think this webscraper can serve as a sub-optimal alternative solution.

How It Works
